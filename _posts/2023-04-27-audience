# Introduction

‘If we want our message to have more impact and to be more persuasive, we need to make it more engaging.’ (Slot, 2019). But who are we engaging with? The issue is that journalists still struggle to understand their target audience, despite the abundance of online data on consumer behaviour.

This topic is discussed in the podcast episode “Episode 4: The audience dilemma (part 1); Everybody is the audience” of the podcast Do we click? by Meijke Slot. This podcast researches the digital relationship between journalists and their audiences. It is supported by the Dutch Journalism Fund and the Erasmus Research Center for Media, Communication and Culture of the Erasmus University of Rotterdam. The research is mainly focused on the Netherlands but the insights Meijke shares are applicable to anyone. Each episode is available in Dutch and in English and I highly recommend you go ahead and listen!
